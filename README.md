# segregate_by_date

Recursively segregate files inside a directory by month and year.
This program extracts the actual recording date (instead of date modified in 
properties) of pictures and videos captured by a camera and moves them into 
directories according to month and year, while preserving the directory structure, 
which would consist of empty directories to remind the user of the original file 
classification. 

## Setup

Run the following commands on the terminal:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/sriramcu/segregate_by_date/`  
`$ cd segregate_by_date/`
